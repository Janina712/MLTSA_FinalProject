Abstract: Epilepsy is a disorder of the central nervous system that affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide. Accurate diagnosis and seizure warning mechanisms are critical to patients’ quality of life and safety. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is the most commonly used clinical tool to observe patterns of brain electricity and to assess changes associated with epilepsy. Manual inspection of EEG is time-consuming, error-prone and dependent on the clinician’s choice of parameters. Recently, there has been great interest in developing machine learning (ML) algorithms to optimize diagnosis and seizure detection. Here, we seek to design ML models that reliably distinguish between epileptic and non-epileptic EEG and identify seizures within the recording.
